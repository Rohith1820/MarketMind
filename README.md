# 🧠 MarketMind  
**AI-Powered Market Research & Strategy Assistant**

🔗 **Live App:** https://marketmind-17.onrender.com/

MarketMind is an AI-driven market research platform that automates **competitor pricing, sentiment insights, feature scoring (radar), market growth trends, and executive strategy synthesis** using a multi-agent architecture (CrewAI) powered by large language models.

Built for **founders, product managers, and strategy teams** who want fast, structured market intelligence without manual research overhead.

## 🚀 What MarketMind Does

MarketMind runs a multi-stage AI pipeline to generate:

- 💰 **Competitor + Product pricing (AI estimated)** saved as JSON
- 💬 **Customer sentiment (AI summary)** saved as JSON + Markdown
- ⚙️ **Feature scoring for product vs competitors (AI scores 0–10)** for radar chart
- 📈 **Market growth projection (AI estimated)** saved as JSON
- 🧾 **Executive-ready strategy report** (Markdown)

All outputs are written to `./outputs/` and visualized in the Streamlit dashboard.

## ✅ What’s New (Latest Changes)

### 1) Custom comparison inputs (user-driven)
Instead of hardcoded competitors/features, the app now lets users **enter their own**:

- **Competitors** (comma-separated)
- **Features to compare** (comma-separated)

These inputs are passed directly into `run_analysis()` so the AI generates pricing + feature scores specifically for the user’s selection.

### 2) Stable outputs handling (fix for Streamlit reruns)
Streamlit reruns the script often. The app now **does NOT delete outputs on every rerun**.

- `outputs/` is only cleared **when the user clicks** **Run Market Research Analysis**
- This prevents missing JSON files and fixes radar/pricing charts failing after UI updates

### 3) Feature radar now reads AI scores from JSON
The radar chart is now driven by:

- `outputs/feature_scores.json`

The app loads this JSON, validates required fields (`product`, `feature`, `score`), and renders a radar chart using Plotly.

### 4) Pricing chart uses AI JSON output (and hover-only values)
Competitor pricing is now driven by:

- `outputs/competitor_prices.json`

The chart:
- includes **product + competitors**
- removes bar labels (values shown on hover)
